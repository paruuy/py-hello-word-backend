# Python Backend Application

This is a simple Python Flask backend application that reads configuration properties from a YAML file and can be containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes using Helm.

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed
- Docker installed
- Helm installed
- Kubernetes cluster (optional for testing the Helm chart)

## Setup to run locally

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-python-app.git
   cd my-python-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build and run the application locally:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to <http://localhost:5002/hello> to see the response.

## Docker build

To build and run the Docker image manually:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-backend .
docker run -p 5002:5002 my-python-backend
```

## Using Pack

To build the Docker image using Pack, run:

```bash
pack build my-python-backend --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1 --path=.
```

To run the application using the docker image generated by Pack build:

```bash
docker run -p 5002:5002 my-python-backend
```

## Helm Chart

To deploy the application in Kubernetes using Helm:

1. Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running.

2. Install the Helm chart:

    ```bash
    helm install my-python-backend ./helm/my-python-backend
    ```

3. Test the deployment:
    - Access the application using port-forwarding:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/my-python-app 5000:5000
    ```

    - Or, if you have an Ingress controller
